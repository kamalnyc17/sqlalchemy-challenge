# SQLAlchemy Challenge
#### In this project we will perform various climate related analysis for Honolulu, Hawaii.
## Precipitation Analysis
### In this analysis we will:-
#### 1. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
#### 2. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
#### 3. Sort the DataFrame values by date and Plot the results using the DataFrame's plot method.
## Station Analysis
### In this analysis we will:-
#### 1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
#### 2. Design a query to find the most active stations and identify the station with highest number of observations.
#### 3. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
#### 4. Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12
